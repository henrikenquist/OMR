%___________________________________________________________________________
%
% spm_matrix returns a matrix defining an orthogonal linear (translation,
% rotation, scaling or affine) transformation given a vector of
% parameters (P).  By default, the transformations are applied in the
% following order (i.e., the opposite to which they are specified):
%
% 1) shear
% 2) scale (zoom)
% 3) rotation - yaw, roll & pitch
% 4) translation
%
% This order can be changed by calling spm_matrix with a string as a
% second argument. This string may contain any valid MATLAB expression
% that returns a 4x4 matrix after evaluation. The special characters 'S',
% 'Z', 'R', 'T' can be used to reference the transformations 1)-4)
% above. The default order is 'T*R*Z*S', as described above.
%
% SPM uses a PRE-multiplication format i.e. Y = A*X where X and Y are 4 x n
% matrices of n coordinates.
